# README Before Starting
The installation is difficult.
### Very old wordpress websites wont work

### You HAVE to change the red marked screenshots to make this BOT WORK

### If a screenshot is not clear enough, the bot will not work. Make sure the screenshot is sharp enough.
Do not apply any other filenames, this will cause the bot to not work:
- ak.png =  Take a screenshot from a SPECIFIC SHELL file and replace the screenshot in ``bot_photos/ak.png`` with it. 
- desktop.png =  Take a screenshot from a how your Desktop logo looks like in file explorer and save it in ``bot_photos/desktop.png``
- exploit.png =  Take a screenshot from a how the WP-XPL0IT file looks like on your PC ``bot_photos/exploit.png``
<br>Do not forget to add the shell file to the directory in WP-XPL0IT root (``ak.png picture defines the bot on what file it needs to click, it will be uploading it on the wordpress website``)<br>
<a href="#installation">After that, follow these installation instructions</a>
### While the bot is running do not move your mouse do not use your computer!
